# FiberPTS: Factory Production Tracking System

## Project Summary

**FiberPTS** aims to provide visibility on manufacturing operations by tracking production throughput, providing key data insights to improve labor and production efficiencies. The system utilizes Supabase, a scalable and secure backend, to manage data across various IoT devices in real-time.

Check out the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWLcf_nFILc&ab_channel=JuanDiegoBecerra).

## Purpose, Scope, and Objectives

The **Factory Production Tracking System (FiberPTS)** leverages IoT devices equipped at various operational points within a manufacturing plant to collect real-time data through operator interactions. This data is then centralized for visualization, offering significant benefits:

- **Efficiency Optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks to accelerate production cycles.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Enhancing managerial decisions with real-time accuracy.
- **Financial Accuracy**: Supporting more precise costing and financial planning.
- **Operational Planning**: Streamlining labor scheduling and deliveries.

### System Components

- **NFC Reader**: Captures data from NFC tags used by employees and for orders.
- **Touch Sensor**: Tracks completed operations done by employees.
- **Display**: Shows order and employee data, and provides interactive feedback to the operator.

 ![ER Diagram for FiberPTS](https://github.com/NxFerrara/FiberPTS/assets/101071768/d94e75f0-4255-4187-80f7-5ef7e1b03b1d)

2. **Database Policies**
   - Set up the following policies on Supabase for data security and accessibility:
     - `devices`, `employees`, `machines`, `orders`: Allow `insert`, `select`, and `update` for anonymous users.
     - `employee_tags`, `order_tag_groups`, `order_tags`: Allow `select` for anonymous users.
     - `action_tap_data`, `employee_tap_data`, `order_tap_data`: Allow `insert` and `select` for anonymous users.

3. **Database Tables Explanation**:
   - **action_tap_data**: Stores data from touch sensor taps as actions are performed.
   - **devices**: Registers each device with its specific location and associated machine.
   - **employee_tags**: Links NFC tags to employee IDs for access and operation logging.
   - **employee_tap_data**: Logs the time when employees start working on a device.
   - **employees**: Contains employee details such as UID and full name for identification.
   - **machines**: Lists machines with their specific identifiers and names for easy tracking.
   - **order_tag_groups**: Groups order tags for batch processing and management.
   - **order_tags**: Associates NFC tags with specific orders for tracking and verification.
   - **order_tap_data**: Logs when an order commences at a machine by a particular employee.
   - **orders**: Catalogues all orders handled by the system for fulfillment and tracking.

4. **.env File Configuration**:
   - Fill out the `.env` file with the necessary details:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_database_url
     DATABASE_API_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
     ```
   - Ensure these values are correct to enable proper database connections.

### System Configuration

It is crucial not to change variable names in the configuration files unless they are updated across the entire codebase:
- **paths.sh**: Manages application paths and system configurations.
- **screen_config.py**: Settings for the display module.
- **touch_sensor_config.py**: Configuration parameters for the touch sensor.
- **globals.sh**: Defines global variables and settings for setup and runtime scripts.
